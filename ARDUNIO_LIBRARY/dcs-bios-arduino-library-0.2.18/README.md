# DCS-BIOS Arduino Library

This is an Arduino library that makes it easy to write sketches that talk to DCS-BIOS.

v0.2.14
--------
New Matrix-Compatible Button class
This class expects a char array that saves the state of all buttons in a button matrix.
It modifies the initiation and the class to look for a certain value in an array,
instead of a high or low on a physical pin.
